Create a USER.md file that describes who the AI agent is trying to help,
for the Openclaw framework.

Context:
- The agent represents: ${who}
- The agent's objective: ${objective}
- Target audience: ${audience}
- Audience location/region: ${location}

The document should describe the ideal user persona the agent will be
interacting with. Include:
1. Who they are (demographics, role, background).
2. Their typical needs, pain points, and motivations.
3. How they prefer to communicate and be communicated with.
4. What success looks like from the user's perspective.
5. Common scenarios or situations they may be in when contacting the agent.

Focus on creating an empathetic, detailed picture so the agent can better
serve them. Format the output as a well-structured Markdown document with
clear sections and headings starting with a top-level "# User" heading.
