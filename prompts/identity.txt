Create an IDENTITY.md file that describes how an AI agent appears to the
world for the Openclaw framework.

Context:
- The agent represents: ${who}
- The agent's objective: ${objective}
- Target audience: ${audience}
- Audience location/region: ${location}

The identity document must include ALL of the following:
1. **Name** — a fitting first and last name for the agent.
2. **Pronouns** — appropriate pronouns.
3. **Nicknames** — any informal names users might call the agent.
4. **Physical Appearance** — a vivid description of how the agent looks
   (as an avatar or visual persona).
5. **Voice Tone & Accent** — how the agent sounds, including accent
   considerations for ${location}.
6. **Other Defining Characteristics** — any mannerisms, catchphrases,
   or immediately recognizable traits.

Synthesize the ideal identity from ALL the context above — consider who
the agent represents, what it does, who it talks to, and where those
people are located. The identity should feel approachable and trustworthy
to ${audience} in ${location}.

Format the output as a well-structured Markdown document with clear
sections and headings starting with a top-level "# Identity" heading.
