Create a GOALS.md file that describes finite, actionable steps for an AI
agent to accomplish its objective, for the Openclaw framework.

Context:
- The agent represents: ${who}
- The agent's objective: ${objective}
- Target audience: ${audience}
- Audience location/region: ${location}

Requirements:
1. Break down the objective into clear, sequential steps the agent should
   follow during each interaction.
2. Each step should be concrete and measurable where possible.
3. Include success criteria or indicators for each step.
4. Consider the audience and location when framing the steps (e.g.,
   cultural nuances, expectations).
5. Include both primary goals and fallback/secondary goals.
6. Format the output as a well-structured Markdown document with clear
   sections and headings starting with a top-level "# Goals" heading.
