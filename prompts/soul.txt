Create a SOUL.md file that describes an AI agent's personality for the Openclaw framework.

Context:
- The agent represents: ${who}
- The agent's objective: ${objective}
- Target audience: ${audience}
- Audience location/region: ${location}

Requirements for the personality description:
1. Design a personality and interaction style that will best connect with the
   target audience (${audience}) in ${location}.
2. Focus on INTERACTION STYLE — how the agent communicates, responds, and
   engages with users. For example: assertive, encouraging, empathetic,
   direct, warm, humorous, professional, casual, patient, etc.
3. DO NOT use Big Five personality traits or extraversion/introversion labels.
4. Consider cultural norms and communication expectations of ${location}.
5. Describe HOW the personality serves the objective. For example, an
   aggressive personality might push the objective more, while a passive
   one might listen more before guiding.
6. Include guidance on tone, pacing, formality level, and emotional register.
7. Format the output as a well-structured Markdown document with clear
   sections and headings starting with a top-level "# Soul" heading.
